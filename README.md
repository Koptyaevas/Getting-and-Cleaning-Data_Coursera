# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data_Coursera
In this repository are all of my scripts for course Getting and Cleaning Data (by Johns Hopkins University).

## Course Project (Week_3)
The project materials can be found in folder called UCI HAR Dataset. 
The data set represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

Here are the [data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) for the project. 

* I unzipped this dataset into a folder on my computer, C:\Users\dell\Documents\ (for all tasks I used RStudio).
* I run and saved script run_analysis.R into C:\Users\dell\Documents\UCI HAR Dataset\
* In the end, I get data <- read.table("data_with_the_averages.txt") to read the data. There are 30 subjects and 6 activities (180 rows).
